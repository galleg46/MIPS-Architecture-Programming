# MIPS Architecture Programming

## Program 1
This program inputs odd integers between [1, 25] into an array. Each time there is a valid input, it will add the value to a total counter.
The program will stop once the value -1 is entered. It will then display the sum of all the numbers, the count, the average, and the remainder if any.
If a value is entered that is less than -1, greater than 25, or is an even number, an error message will be prompted. The user will then be re-prompted to enter a value.

## Program 2
This program adds the values of two arrays together incrementally to form a new array that contains the sums. All arrays will be printed out to the 
console when complete, but the summed-up array will be printed backwards. The program will start with a static array of eleven fixed integers:
[9, 18, 3, 8, 11, 6, 14, 1, 10, 4, 14]

## Program 3
This program creates an array and performs various tasks with it. The array length will be between 5 and 15 (inclusive). Once the array has been created, 
it will print to the console in a readable format. Then it will sum up all the even values contained in the array, returning the sum and the number of 
even values. Then it will calculate the average, then print the sum, count, and average.

## Program 4
This program is a rudimentary ordering system. The user will be prompted for a number greater than zero to create an array of double precision. It will then 
read in prices greater than zero to fill the array. It will then print the sum of all the numbers in the array. (Not fully implemented)

## Program 6
This program will ask the user to specify the dimensions of a matrix, it then dynamically allocates it and reads double precision numbers to fill it. It will 
then print out the matrix to the console in table format. Then the program will create a new matrix containing the transpose of the matrix to the console in 
table format. Finally, the user will be prompted to enter a valid row and column index of the transposed array, and a submatrix excluding the row and column 
will be printed to the console. The data in the 2-dimensional array will be stored in column-major order. (Not fully implemented)
